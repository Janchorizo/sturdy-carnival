    <h2>The exam results</h2>
    <p>
        Let's simulate the exam results. Each exam has an integer numeric value
        ranging from 0 to 100, each of which will be assigned a rank based on the
        cuts set on the <b>ECDF</b> section <i>(left side of the screen)</i>.
        <br/>
        <i class='text-muted'>
            A good cut value is the one that ensures the biggest gap with the
            next possible rank.
