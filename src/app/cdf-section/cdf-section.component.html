    <h1>Assigning ranks</h1>
    <h2>using an Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function</h2>
    <p>
        Grade boundaries are better assigned using the ECDF to find
        the cuts, as it allows to easily find distinguishable groups
        of marks.
        <br/>
        We can then search for cuts that would make a student's grade
        the furthest from the next rank.
